Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts is a component for interactive pivot reports that can be [inserted to a web page or a web application](https://www.flexmonster.com/demos/pivot-table-js/?r=npm). It’s a powerful JavaScript tool to visualize your business data.

Flexmonster Pivot is a cross-platform web component that seamlessly works on any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari or Opera) across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS or Android. 

Moreover, you have no limitation on server-side technology, no matter whether your website runs on .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby, etc.

# Installation and usage
Start by installing Flexmonster as a node module and save it as a dependency in your package.json:

# Why use Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts component?

## Easy to integrate

Flexmonster Pivot can be natively used with JavaScript or [TypeScript](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-typescript/?r=npm) and perfectly integrates with the following client-side frameworks: 

- [AngularJS](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-angularjs/?r=npm)
- [Angular](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-angular/?r=npm)
- [React](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-react/?r=npm)
- [Webpack](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-webpack/?r=npm)

## Supports the most common data sources

- [JSON](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/json-data-source/?r=npm)
- [SQL databases](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-relational-database/?r=npm) (MS SQL, MySQL and others) 
- [CSV](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/csv-data-source/?r=npm)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-elasticsearch/?r=npm)
- [Microsoft Analysis Services OLAP cubes](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-microsoft-analysis-services/?r=npm)
- [Mondrian](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-pentaho-mondrian/?r=npm)

## High speed in visualizing your data 

This solution allows you to work extremely fast with really [large data volumes](https://www.flexmonster.com/demos/?r=npm) (huge OLAP cubes, data sets from SQL DBs or files up to 140 MB).

Maximum data size is limited only by your end-users’ browsers and the capacity of their devices. The table renders multiple millions of cells immediately. If the user’s browser can handle it, we’ll display it.

Moreover, we have developed a special application. It compresses the data and makes it load 3-4 times faster. [Flexmonster Data Compressor](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-relational-database/?r=npm) is freely available in different technologies, as follows: .NET, Java, PHP, and Node.js.

Working with OLAP cubes, a browser component can communicate with the server via XMLA protocol or you can use [Flexmonster Accelerator for OLAP cubes](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/getting-started-with-accelerator-ssas/?r=npm). It’s a special server-side proxy that helps you to increase data loading speed from server to customer’s browser tenfold.

## Smart features to analyze and manage your data

## Compose report layout
Select which dimensions & values to show.
Users can easily change a report’s layout visually and examine the data from a different perspective. The power of Pivot report composing allows you to stop guessing all possible report scenarios your end-users might require. The user will be able to tune it to their own needs on the fly.

## Save & load reports
Users can create their own reports and save them to their local drive or the server and load previously saved reports with exactly the same layout, number formatting, filters, sorting and all the other settings.

This allows users to work with a predefined set of reports or create & save their own reports. Once the user has composed a report to reveal the precise data views that they need, they may want to save it for the future or share it with others.


## Export & print

All table views (compact/classic/flat form) and charts view can be printed or exported.
Users can export the reports into a variety of formats:

- Microsoft Excel 7
- PDF
- Web page (HTML page)
- CSV (comma separated text format)
- Image (PNG)   

You can control where to save the export data, the following methods are supported:

- Save to local file
- Save to server (to remote file-storage or database)
